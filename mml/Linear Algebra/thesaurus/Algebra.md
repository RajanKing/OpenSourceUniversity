Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. These symbols often represent numbers, variables (like xxx or yyy), or other quantities. Algebra allows us to express general mathematical relationships and to solve equations.

In algebra, you work with:

- **Variables**: Symbols that stand in for unknown or variable quantities.
- **Constants**: Fixed values that do not change.
- **Operations**: Actions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Equations**: Mathematical statements that express the equality of two expressions, often involving variables and constants.

Algebra can be thought of as a generalization of arithmetic, where instead of working with specific numbers, you work with symbols to describe patterns, solve problems, and express relationships that apply in a wide range of situations. It's a foundational area of mathematics used in nearly all other branches of math and in many real-world applications.
