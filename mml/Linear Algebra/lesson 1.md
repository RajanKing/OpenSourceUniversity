**Making math concepts clear**

To make math ideas easy to understand, people often create **sets of things with rules for how they work**. This is called an **algebra**.

**Linear algebra** is the study of **vectors**, which are special kinds of objects that can be added or multiplied together using specific rules.

**Types of vectors**

There's a type of vector we learned in school, marked with an arrow above the letter (e.g. â†’x). In this book, we'll learn about more general and powerful concepts of vectors, represented by **bold letters** (e.g. x, y).


In the context of machine learning (ML) and data science, linear algebra is a set of mathematical techniques used
to:

1. **Represent and manipulate high-dimensional data**: Linear algebra helps transform complex data into more
manageable forms, making it easier to analyze and visualize.
2. **Perform transformations on data**: Techniques like matrix multiplication and vector projections are essential
for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction.
3. **Build and train machine learning models**: Linear algebra is used in many ML algorithms, such as linear
regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.
4. **Analyze and visualize complex relationships**: Linear algebra helps identify patterns and relationships
within the data, enabling better understanding of the underlying system.

**Key concepts:**

1. **Vectors and matrices**: Representing data points and relationships using vectors and matrices.
2. **Linear transformations**: Applying mathematical operations to transform and manipulate data.
3. **Eigenvalues and eigenvectors**: Understanding how linear systems respond to transformations.
4. **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**: Breaking down complex datasets into simpler components.

**Benefits in ML and DS:**

1. **Improved model accuracy**: Linear algebra techniques help build more accurate machine learning models.
2. **Efficient data processing**: Linear algebra enables faster and more efficient data processing, reducing
computational costs.
3. **Better understanding of relationships**: Linear algebra provides insights into complex relationships within
the data.

In summary, linear algebra is a fundamental tool in ML and DS, enabling researchers to:

* Represent and manipulate high-dimensional data
* Perform transformations on data
* Build and train machine learning models
* Analyze and visualize complex relationships
