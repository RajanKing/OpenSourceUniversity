Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics focused on the study of vectors, vector spaces (also known as linear spaces), linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. It deals with concepts like matrices, determinants, and eigenvalues, which are used to represent and solve linear relationships. Linear algebra is foundational in many fields, including computer science, physics, engineering, and economics, because it provides the tools to model and solve problems involving linear systems. 

At its core, linear algebra is about understanding and manipulating lines, planes, and higher-dimensional analogs, and it is essential for analyzing multidimensional data, which is common in many modern applications.
