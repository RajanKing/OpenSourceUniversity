In common usage, data  is a collection of discrete or continuous values that convey information, describing the quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally.

Facts, numbers, words, or other information that is stored and used by a computer or system.

In simple terms:

* Numbers (e.g. 5, 10, 25)
* Words (e.g. cat, dog, car)
* Text (e.g. news articles, emails)
* Images (e.g. photos, videos)
* Audio files (e.g. music, voice recordings)

Think of data like a collection of books in a library â€“ each book has its own information and value!
