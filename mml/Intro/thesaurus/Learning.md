The process of improving the model by adjusting its rules or patterns based on experience with the
data.

In simple terms:

* When a computer "learns" from data, it's actually changing its internal rules to better fit the data
* It's like getting feedback and adjusting your approach accordingly
* A way for the computer to get smarter over time as it sees more data

Think of learning like practicing a sport â€“ at first, you might not be very good, but with practice (experience), you improve and get better!

`Learning can be understood as a learning way to automatically find patterns and structure in data by optimizing the parameters of the model`
