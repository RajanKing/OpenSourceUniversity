A mathematical representation or structure that helps make sense of the data.

In simple terms:

* A set of rules or patterns that explain how the data behaves
* A "blueprint" for understanding what's happening in the data
* A way to predict or forecast future outcomes based on past data

Think of a model like a map â€“ it shows you where you've been, and helps you navigate where you're going!

In machine learning, a model is used to:

* Identify relationships between variables
* Make predictions about new, unseen data
* Help make decisions based on the data

`A model is said to learn from data if its performance on a given task improves after the data is taken into account. The goal is to find good models that generalize well to yet unseen data, which we may care about in the future. `
