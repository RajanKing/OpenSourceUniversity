Aye, aye, captain! Let’s build a small demo project: **The Straw Hat Calculator** — a tool the Straw Hat Pirates would use to calculate the treasure they’ve found, their next destination’s distance, or even split the treasure equally among the crew! We’ll use everything we’ve learned so far: loops, conditionals, operators, and more.

### **Straw Hat Calculator** Overview:
Our calculator will be able to:
1. Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. Check if a number is prime (useful for Robin’s research!).
3. Split the treasure equally among the crew (using loops).
4. Include a fun bonus where the user can help Luffy decide whether to fight or flee based on the enemy's strength and speed.

---

### Step 1: Define the Calculator Menu
First, we’ll create a menu that lets the user choose which operation to perform.

```python
def show_menu():
    print("\nAhoy, Straw Hat! What would you like to do?")
    print("1. Perform a basic arithmetic operation")
    print("2. Check if a number is prime")
    print("3. Split treasure equally among the crew")
    print("4. Help Luffy decide whether to fight or flee")
    print("5. Exit the calculator")
```

---

### Step 2: Implement Basic Arithmetic Operations
This part will handle the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

```python
def basic_operations():
    print("\nTime to calculate some treasure!")
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    print("\nChoose the operation:")
    print("1. Addition (+)")
    print("2. Subtraction (-)")
    print("3. Multiplication (*)")
    print("4. Division (/)")

    operation = input("Enter the operation: ")

    if operation == '1':
        result = num1 + num2
        print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {result}.")
    elif operation == '2':
        result = num1 - num2
        print(f"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {result}.")
    elif operation == '3':
        result = num1 * num2
        print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {result}.")
    elif operation == '4':
        if num2 != 0:
            result = num1 / num2
            print(f"{num1} divided by {num2} equals {result}.")
        else:
            print("Oops! Division by zero is not allowed!")
    else:
        print("Invalid operation selected!")
```

---

### Step 3: Prime Number Check
Robin needs a prime number check for her Poneglyph research! We’ll help her by writing a function that checks whether a number is prime.

```python
def is_prime():
    print("\nLet’s see if your number is prime!")
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    if num < 2:
        print(f"{num} is NOT a prime number.")
        return

    is_prime = True
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            print(f"{num} is divisible by {i}.")
            break

    if is_prime:
        print(f"{num} is a prime number!")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is NOT a prime number.")
```

---

### Step 4: Split Treasure Among the Crew
Sanji needs to split the treasure equally among the crew. We’ll use loops and arithmetic to divide the treasure.

```python
def split_treasure():
    print("\nTime to split the treasure!")
    treasure = float(input("Enter the total treasure amount (in berries): "))
    crew_members = int(input("Enter the number of crew members: "))

    if crew_members > 0:
        share = treasure / crew_members
        print(f"Each crew member gets {share:.2f} berries!")
    else:
        print("You need at least one crew member to split the treasure!")
```

---

### Step 5: Help Luffy Decide to Fight or Flee
Luffy must decide whether to fight an enemy based on their strength and speed. Let’s help him make that decision using conditionals!

```python
def fight_or_flee():
    print("\nLuffy needs your help to decide!")
    enemy_fast = input("Is the enemy fast? (yes/no): ").lower() == 'yes'
    enemy_strong = input("Is the enemy strong? (yes/no): ").lower() == 'yes'

    if enemy_fast and enemy_strong:
        print("Luffy uses Tankman!")
    elif enemy_fast:
        print("Luffy uses Snakeman!")
    elif enemy_strong:
        print("Luffy uses Boundman!")
    else:
        print("Luffy decides to fight in base form!")
```

---

### Step 6: Putting It All Together
Now, we’ll put everything together into a loop that allows the user to choose from the menu and use the calculator multiple times.

```python
def straw_hat_calculator():
    while True:
        show_menu()
        choice = input("\nEnter your choice (1-5): ")

        if choice == '1':
            basic_operations()
        elif choice == '2':
            is_prime()
        elif choice == '3':
            split_treasure()
        elif choice == '4':
            fight_or_flee()
        elif choice == '5':
            print("Goodbye, Straw Hat! Until next time!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice! Please select a valid option.")
```

### Step 7: Let’s Run Our Project!

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    straw_hat_calculator()
```

---

### **Sample Output**
```
Ahoy, Straw Hat! What would you like to do?
1. Perform a basic arithmetic operation
2. Check if a number is prime
3. Split treasure equally among the crew
4. Help Luffy decide whether to fight or flee
5. Exit the calculator

Enter your choice (1-5): 1

Time to calculate some treasure!
Enter the first number: 100
Enter the second number: 50

Choose the operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter the operation: 1
The sum of 100.0 and 50.0 is 150.0.
```

### **Explanation:**
- We’ve used **if-else** statements to help Luffy decide whether to fight or flee.
- We’ve used **for loops** to check for prime numbers for Robin’s research.
- We’ve implemented **basic arithmetic operations** with operators like addition and division for counting treasure.
- We split the treasure using **loops and conditionals**, making sure the crew gets their fair share.

And that’s it! The **Straw Hat Calculator** is now complete! You can use this to calculate everything from the treasure’s value to Luffy’s battle strategies. Happy coding, captain!
