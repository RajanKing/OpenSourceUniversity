### 🏴‍☠️ Operators in Python

**Operators** are like special tools in a pirate's toolkit, essential for navigating the seas of coding. Each operator serves a unique purpose, helping us perform various tasks. Let's explore these operators through our adventure!

### 🚢 Types of Operators

1. **Arithmetic Operators**  
2. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**  
3. **Logical (Boolean) Operators**  
4. **Bitwise Operators**  
5. **Assignment Operators**  
6. **Special Operators**

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**

In the bustling port town of **Arithmetic**, our brave captain, Captain Add, was always busy counting treasures. With his trusty map marked with symbols, he could quickly tally up his riches using the arithmetic operators:

- **Addition (`+`)**: Captain Add would add his gold coins together to see how much treasure he had amassed.  
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: After sharing some gold with his crew, he’d subtract the amount given away.  
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: When the crew won a bounty, he multiplied their shares based on the crew size.  
- **Division (`/`)**: Dividing the spoils among his crew was always a task for Captain Divide.  
- **Modulo (`%`)**: When they found out how many coins would be left over after sharing equally, Captain Modulo would step in.  
- **Floor Division (`//`)**: Captain Floor had a keen eye for the number of complete shares each crew member would receive.  
- **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Whenever they found treasure maps leading to treasure multiplied by itself, Captain Exponent would lead the way!

**Example:**

```python
x, y = 10, 20

# Addition
print(x + y)  # Output: 30
```

### 2. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**

In the land of **Comparison**, the wise judge, Judge Relational, was always keen on making decisions based on facts. He would ask questions to find out which pirate was the mightiest or the swiftest by comparing their strengths. His tools were the comparison operators:

- **Greater than (`>`)**: "Is Pirate Bill stronger than Pirate Jack?"  
- **Less than (`<`)**: "Is Pirate Sam quicker than Pirate Dave?"  
- **Equal to (`==`)**: "Are they equally skilled?"  
- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: "Is there any difference in their treasure?"  
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: "Is she as talented as her sister, or better?"  
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: "Is he at least as fast as the last crew member?"

**Example:**

```python
a, b = 10, 20

print(a < b)   # Output: True
```

### 3. **Logical (Boolean) Operators**

In the strategic war room of **Logical**, Captain Logic gathered his crew for discussions about their plans. The three wise advisors—Sir AND, Lady OR, and Lord NOT—helped make critical decisions:

- **AND**: "If both the tides are favorable **and** the winds are right, we shall set sail!"  
- **OR**: "If we can find treasure **or** a new ship, our journey shall be worthwhile!"  
- **NOT**: "If we **do not** encounter enemy ships, we can sail without worry!"

**Example:**

```python
a, b = True, False

# Logical AND
print(a and b)  # Output: False
```

### 4. **Bitwise Operators**

Deep within the **Bitwise** realm, the Binary Knights worked tirelessly. Each knight specialized in manipulating the bits of treasure maps. They could dig deep into the binary treasure of numbers:

- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Two knights would work together, uniting only their common bits.  
- **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Whenever they merged their maps, they’d combine all possible routes.  
- **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: The reverse knight flipped all bits, revealing hidden paths.  
- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: The clever knight who identified differences among maps was always on alert.  
- **Bitwise right shift (`>>`)**: Shifting the map right showed the crew what lay ahead.  
- **Bitwise left shift (`<<`)**: Shifting left expanded their horizons and revealed treasures further away.

**Example:**

```python
a, b = 10, 4

# Bitwise AND
print(a & b)  # Output: 0
```

### 5. **Assignment Operators**

In the castle of **Assignment**, the royal scribe, Sir Assign, diligently wrote down the treasures and treasures yet to be found. He would use his various quills—each representing an assignment operator—to keep track of the kingdom's wealth:

- **Simple assignment (`=`)**: "Here is the value of our treasure chest!"  
- **Add and assign (`+=`)**: "Let’s add more gold to our treasure chest!"  
- **Subtract and assign (`-=`)**: "We’ve given away some treasure; let’s adjust the chest!"  
- **Multiply and assign (`*=`)**: "If we win more gold, multiply our riches!"  
- **Divide and assign (`/=`)**: "Dividing our spoils requires an adjustment!"  
- **Modulo and assign (`%=`)**: "Let’s find out what remains after sharing!"  
- **Floor divide and assign (`//=`)**: "We’ll only take complete shares!"  
- **Exponent and assign (`**=`)**: "Let’s double our treasure!"

**Example:**

```python
a = 10

a += 5    # a = a + 5
print(a)  # Output: 15
```

### 6. **Special Operators**

In the land of **Special Operators**, there were unique guards who ensured that treasures were handled correctly. The wise elders, Sir Identity and Lady Membership, kept an eye on the variables:

#### **Identity Operators**

Sir Identity checked if two treasures were the same by asking, "Are these two chests one and the same?" 

- **is**: "Do they share the same golden contents?"  
- **is not**: "Are they different in their essence?"

**Example:**

```python
a = 5
b = 5

print(a is b)  # Output: True
```

#### **Membership Operators**

Lady Membership stood at the gates, asking if the treasure was included in the lists of riches:

- **in**: "Is this gold coin part of our collection?"  
- **not in**: "Is this coin missing from our treasure chest?"

**Example:**

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Check if 1 is present in the list
print(1 in lst)  # Output: True
```
