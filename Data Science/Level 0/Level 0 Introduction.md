**Luffy's Introduction:**:

**Meet [[Luffy]]!**
You might be wondering who I am, right?
![[luffy.png|400x400]]

Well, let me tell you... My name is Monkey D. Luffy, but my friends call me Luffy!

I'm a young pirate with big dreams and an even bigger appetite for adventure! When I'm not sailing the seas on my trusty ship, the Thousand Sunny, you can find me exploring hidden caves,  solving puzzles, or just enjoying a nice plate of meat!


**The Curious Pirate:**

But what makes me special? Well, I've got a curious mind that's always wondering "what if?" and a heart full of enthusiasm for trying new things! Whether it's discovering a new island, meeting new friends, or learning about the world of science and technology, you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be right in the middle of it all!

**The Story Begins:**

So, buckle up and join me on this epic adventure as we explore the fascinating world of computer science and programming! We'll meet amazing people, learn cool concepts, and have a whale of a time doing it! 

Luffy is standing on the deck of the Thousand Sunny, looking out at the vast ocean. He takes a deep breath,
feeling the salty air fill his lungs.

"Hey, I wonder what kind of adventures await me out there?" Luffy says to himself, excitement building in his
voice.

This brief introduction sets the stage for our story and establishes Luffy's curiosity and love for adventure. We
can then use this as a springboard to introduce the concept of computer science and programming in a fun, engaging
way.

What do you think? Does this sound like a good starting point?

>>> we get the strat with saying what is scince what is technology
Let's start fresh and explore the world of science and technology through Luffy's eyes.

Here's a possible introduction:

**Luffy's Curious Mind:**

Luffy looks out at the vast ocean, his mind wandering to all the wonders that lie beneath the surface. He thinks
about the ships he's sailed on, the people he's met, and the things he's learned.

"Hmm... What is science?" Luffy asks himself, scratching his head. "I know it has something to do with
understanding how things work."

He remembers learning about basic concepts in school, like gravity, motion, and energy. But there's so much more
to explore!

Suddenly, a spark of curiosity ignites within him. "Ah ha! I want to learn more about science!"

**Luffy Discovers Technology:**

As he continues to ponder the mysteries of science, Luffy stumbles upon an old computer in the Thousand Sunny's
cargo hold. It's dusty and outdated, but something catches his eye.

"What's this thing?" Luffy asks the ship's crew. "Is it a tool for finding treasure?"

The crew chuckles and explains that it's actually a computer, a machine that can process information and solve
problems.

Luffy's eyes widen with excitement. "Whoa! That sounds like magic!"

**The Journey Begins:**

With his curiosity piqued, Luffy decides to embark on a journey of discovery, exploring the world of science and
technology. He wants to learn about computers, programming, and all the amazing things they can do.

And that's where we'll start our adventure together!

## The Story Begins


Let’s start at the very beginning—where every great adventure begins—with a bit of history. You see, computers weren’t always the sleek, powerful machines we have today. Long before the Thousand Sunny sailed the seas, and even before the first pirate ever set foot on a ship, people were thinking about ways to make calculations easier. The earliest ‘computers’ were simple tools like the [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus), used to count and perform basic arithmetic. But as time went on, people dreamed bigger.

![[Abacus of Garp.png]]
Fast forward to the 19th century, where a brilliant mind by the name of [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage)imagined a machine that could perform any calculation you could think of. This idea eventually led to the creation of the first [mechanical computer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_computer). They were huge, clunky machines that took up entire rooms! But just like a pirate ship needs a crew, these early computers needed someone to tell them what to do. That’s where the idea of **[programming ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)** was born.
![[mechanical computer.png]]

Programming is like giving orders to your crew; you have to be clear and precise, or things can go very wrong! In the world of computer science, we use something called **programming logic and flow** to make sure our commands are followed exactly as intended. Just like plotting a course on a map, we create a sequence of steps, ensuring that the computer knows exactly what to do and when to do it.
![[Programming.jpg]]

![[intro.jpg]]

Meet Luffy, the aspiring Pirate King with a big heart and an even bigger appetite for adventure! One sunny afternoon, while the Thousand Sunny cruised through the Grand Line, Luffy stumbled upon something strange—a laptop glowing with excitement. On the screen, a simple message caught his eye:

```python
Name = input("What's your name, pirate? ")
print(f'Welcome {Name}! \nHow come you have sailed here today? \nWhat do you want to explore this time?')
```

![[Luffy_laptop.png]]
Luffy's eyes widened as he typed, “Luffy” and pressed Enter.

“**Welcome Luffy! How come you have sailed here today? What do you want to explore this time?**” the screen replied.

“Whoa, how did it know my name?” Luffy wondered, scratching his head. “Can it do this with anyone’s name?”

**The Code Explained:**
"Well, Luffy," you say, "this is called a **program**. It’s like giving orders to your crew; you have to be clear and precise, or things can go very wrong! This particular program is written in a language called **Python**."

"See this part here?"

```python
Name = input("What's your name, pirate? ")
```

"When you typed your name, it got stored in a special container called a **variable**. In this case, the variable is named `Name`. A variable can hold different types of information, just like how your backpack can carry food, treasure, or even Chopper!"

Luffy's eyes sparkled with excitement. “So, this `Name` can be different every time? Like if Zoro types his name, it will say ‘Welcome Zoro’?”

“Exactly, Luffy!” you confirm. “That’s the magic of variables—they store data that can change. Let’s try it with another name!”

---

### **Luffy's Experiment:**

Luffy called out to his crew. “Hey, Zoro! Come here and try this!” 

Zoro, half-asleep as usual, wandered over. He typed his name.

“**Welcome Zoro! How come you have sailed here today? What do you want to explore this time?**” the screen replied.

“Woah!” Luffy exclaimed. “It really works! But... how?”
#### A Pirate's Guide to Variables and Data Types:

![[Begining/lesson 0/OpenSourceUniversity/Data Science/Level 0/images/variable.png]]

“Let’s dive deeper into this, Luffy,” you say, pulling out a map of programming concepts.

---

## **Variables: The Treasure Chests of Code** 

Now, let’s talk about **Variables** and **data types**.

Imagine you’ve just found a treasure chest on a deserted island. Inside, you find gold coins, jewels, and maybe even a rare Devil Fruit! Each of these items represents a different type of **data**. Some of them might be whole numbers (like counting coins), others might be text (like a note in a bottle), and some might be more complex (like the powers of a Devil Fruit). In computer science, we store these different kinds of data in something called **variables**. Think of variables as treasure chests that can hold any kind of loot—whether it’s a number, a piece of text, or something more mysterious.

In Python, a variable is a name you give to a piece of data so you can find it later.

“So `Name` was just a treasure chest that stored my name!” Luffy jumped with excitement.

“Exactly! And just like how different chests can hold different things, variables can hold different types of data.”

And just like every item in a pirate’s treasure has a value, every piece of data in a computer has a **data type**. This helps the computer know how to handle it. Is it a number that needs to be added or subtracted? Or is it text that needs to be displayed on a screen? Understanding data types is like knowing the value of the treasure you’ve found—it’s key to making sure you use it wisely.

Here’s a simple example in Python, a popular programming language:

```python
# Let's say Luffy finds 10 gold coins
gold_coins = 10  # This is a variable of type integer

# He also finds a note that says "Adventure awaits!"
note = "Adventure awaits!"  # This is a variable of type string (text)

# And what if Luffy finds a Devil Fruit? Let's call it "Gomu Gomu no Mi"
devil_fruit = "Gomu Gomu no Mi"  # Another string type variable
```

In this example, `gold_coins` is a number (an integer), while `note` and `devil_fruit` are strings (pieces of text). Each variable holds a different type of data, just like each item in a treasure chest has a different value.

---
## **Data Types: The Types of Treasure**

“Not all treasures are the same, right? There are gold coins, maps, and even strange fruits that give you powers! Similarly, in Python, data comes in different types, like numbers, text, and even lists of items.”

- **String (str)**: This is like a map, containing words and letters.
  - Example: `"Luffy"` is a string, just like how `Name` was storing a name.
  
- **Integer (int)**: This is like counting your gold coins.
  - Example: `gold_coin = 10` means the treasure chest `gold_coin` holds 10 gold coins.
  
- **Float (float)**: When you want to measure things precisely, like the weight of a giant fish.
  - Example: `weight = 75.5` means `weight` is holding the value 75.5.
  
- **Boolean (bool)**: This is like a true or false question.
  - Example: `is_pirate = True` means the treasure chest `is_pirate` holds the value `True`.

Exploring Variables with the Crew

"Let's write a little program that uses more variables and see how they work!" you suggest. Luffy nods enthusiastically.

**Example Program:**

```python
# Let's gather some details about the pirate crew
captain = "Luffy"  # A string variable
crew_count = 10  # An integer variable
ship_name = "Thousand Sunny"  # Another string variable
has_treasure = True  # A boolean variable

# Print out the details
print(f"Our captain's name is {captain}.")
print(f"We have {crew_count} crew members.")
print(f"Our ship is called the {ship_name}.")
print(f"Do we have treasure on board? {has_treasure}")
```

Luffy watched in awe as the program printed out the details of the crew. "Wow! It knows everything about us!"

"Yes, Luffy," you laugh. "Because we stored all the information in variables. And each variable has a different **data type**. Just like how you wouldn’t put a giant fish in a small chest, you must use the right data type to store your information!"

![[datatypes.jpg]]

---

### **Luffy's Curiosity Unleashed:**

“Can I use these ‘variables’ to store anything?” Luffy asked, his curiosity piqued.

“Absolutely! You can store anything from the number of gold coins to the name of your ship, and even whether you’ve found the One Piece!”

Luffy grinned, clearly excited about the possibilities. “This is so cool! But, how does the computer know what type of treasure—err, I mean, data—it is?”

“Well, in Python, the computer figures it out on its own! But in some other programming languages, you have to tell the computer what type of data you’re storing, like saying, ‘This chest only holds gold coins!’”

---

### **Conclusion:**

"So, Luffy," you wrap up, "variables and data types are the foundation of programming. They allow you to store and manage all kinds of information, just like you store different treasures in different chests!"

Luffy nodded, a determined look on his face. “I’m going to master these variables and data types, just like I’ll master the Grand Line!”

And so, with a newfound understanding of programming, Luffy and his crew set sail on the next leg of their adventure, ready to discover the wonders of the digital world, one variable at a time!

Here's a small exercise for the reader to practice working with variables in Python. This exercise is designed to reinforce the concepts of variable declaration, assignment, and basic operations.

---

---
### **Exercise Wrap-Up**

Once you’ve completed these exercises, you’ll have a better grasp of Python’s identifiers and keywords! Remember, every pirate must know their ship’s crew by name, and every programmer must know how to name their variables correctly.

Keep practicing, and soon you’ll be navigating the high seas of Python programming with ease!


---

### **Exercise: Pirate Crew Logbook**

Welcome, young pirate! It's time to put your programming skills to the test. Below are a few tasks to help you practice using variables. Grab your digital pen, and let’s start coding!

#### **Exercise 1: Setting Sail with Variables**

1. **Create a variable named `captain_name`** and set it to your favorite pirate captain’s name.
2. **Create a variable named `crew_members`** and set it to the number of crew members on your ship.
3. **Create a variable named `ship_speed`** and set it to the speed of your ship in knots (use a decimal value).
4. **Create a variable named `has_treasure_map`** and set it to `True` if your ship has a treasure map, otherwise set it to `False`.

**Example:**

```python
captain_name = "Monkey D. Luffy"  # A string variable
crew_members = 10  # An integer variable
ship_speed = 17.5  # A float variable
has_treasure_map = True  # A boolean variable
```

#### **Exercise 2: Displaying Your Pirate Ship's Details**

1. Print a message showing the name of your captain.
2. Print a message showing how many crew members are on board.
3. Print a message showing the speed of your ship.
4. Print a message that says if you have a treasure map or not.

**Example Output:**

```
Our captain is Monkey D. Luffy.
We have 10 crew members on board.
Our ship is sailing at 17.5 knots.
Do we have a treasure map? True
```

#### **Exercise 3: Pirate Arithmetic**

1. **Increase the number of `crew_members` by 5.** A few new pirates have joined your crew!
2. **Decrease the `ship_speed` by 2.5 knots.** There’s a storm approaching, so you need to slow down.
3. Print the updated number of crew members and ship speed.

**Example:**

```python
crew_members = crew_members + 5  # New pirates join the crew!
ship_speed = ship_speed - 2.5  # Slowing down due to a storm

print(f"Updated crew count: {crew_members}")
print(f"Updated ship speed: {ship_speed} knots")
```

**Example Output:**

```
Updated crew count: 15
Updated ship speed: 15.0 knots
```

#### **Exercise 4: Choosing the Destination**

1. Create a new variable called `destination` and set it to the name of an island you want to visit.
2. Print a message saying where your ship is heading.

**Example:**

```python
destination = "Raftel"  # String variable for the destination
print(f"The {captain_name}'s crew is heading towards {destination}!")
```

**Example Output:**

```
The Monkey D. Luffy's crew is heading towards Raftel!
```

#### **Exercise 5: Bonus Challenge**

1. Use `input()` to ask the user for the name of their ship and store it in a variable called `ship_name`.
2. Print a welcome message that includes the `captain_name`, `ship_name`, and `destination`.

**Example:**

```python
ship_name = input("What's the name of your ship, pirate? ")
print(f"Welcome aboard the {ship_name}! Captain {captain_name} is taking us to {destination}.")
```

---

#### **Test Your Code!**

After completing the tasks, run your program and check the output. Did everything work as expected? If you encountered any issues, try to debug your code and make corrections. Remember, programming is all about practicing and learning from your mistakes. Happy coding, young pirate!



---
### **Understanding Python Keywords and Identifiers**

Ahoy there, budding pirate! Before we set sail into deeper waters, let’s take a quick detour to understand something very important—**keywords** and **identifiers** in Python. Think of **keywords** as reserved commands that only the language can use, while **identifiers** are like the unique names you give to your crew (variables, functions, classes) so you can tell them apart!

---

### **Keywords: The Sacred Commands of Python**

Just like how a pirate captain has special commands that the crew must follow, Python has its own set of **keywords**—specific words that the language uses to do important things. You can’t use these keywords for your own variable names because Python needs them to navigate and run programs.

If you want to see all the keywords Python 3.6 uses, you can run this quick program:

```python
# Get all keywords in Python 3.6
import keyword

print(keyword.kwlist)
print("Total number of keywords: ", len(keyword.kwlist))
```

When you run this, you’ll see a list of reserved keywords like `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, and many more. You may not fully understand how all these work just yet, but don’t worry—we’ll cover them in detail as we continue our adventure!

**Keywords Example**:
```python
global = 1  # ❌ This will cause a SyntaxError because 'global' is a reserved keyword
```

---

### **Identifiers: Naming Your Crew**

An **identifier** is a name you give to various entities in Python, like variables, functions, classes, etc. It's how you tell the different parts of your program apart—just like how you give each member of your pirate crew a name. Without identifiers, you wouldn’t know who’s who!

#### **Rules for Writing Identifiers**:

1. **Combination of letters, digits, and underscores**: Identifiers can be made up of lowercase letters (`a-z`), uppercase letters (`A-Z`), digits (`0-9`), and underscores (`_`).
   
   **Example**:
   ```python
   pirate_name = "Luffy"  # ✅ Valid
   treasure_chest_1 = 100  # ✅ Valid
   ```

2. **Cannot start with a digit**: Identifiers must start with a letter or an underscore. You can't start an identifier with a number.
   
   **Example**:
   ```python
   1pirate = "Zoro"  # ❌ Invalid
   pirate1 = "Sanji"  # ✅ Valid
   ```

3. **Keywords cannot be used as identifiers**: As we mentioned earlier, reserved keywords cannot be used as names for variables or functions.
   
   **Example**:
   ```python
   global = 5  # ❌ SyntaxError: 'global' is a keyword and can't be used as an identifier
   ```

4. **No special symbols allowed**: Identifiers cannot contain special characters like `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, etc. You can only use letters, numbers, and underscores.
   
   **Example**:
   ```python
   treasure@chest = 100  # ❌ SyntaxError: '@' is not allowed in variable names
   ```

---

### **Example Code: Identifiers in Action**

Let’s write a small program to demonstrate identifiers and keywords:

```python
# Identifiers
pirate_name = "Monkey D. Luffy"  # Valid identifier
crew_size = 10  # Valid identifier

# Printing values
print(f"Our captain is {pirate_name} and we have {crew_size} crew members.")

# Trying to use a keyword as an identifier (this will cause an error)
if = "Navigator"  # ❌ SyntaxError: 'if' is a keyword
```

In the example above, the identifiers `pirate_name` and `crew_size` are used to store the name of the pirate captain and the size of the crew. But if you try to use a keyword like `if` as an identifier, Python will throw a `SyntaxError`.

---

### **Summary of the Rules for Identifiers**

1. Identifiers can be made up of letters, digits, and underscores.
2. They **cannot** start with a digit.
3. Python **keywords** (like `if`, `while`, `for`) cannot be used as identifiers.
4. Special characters like `@`, `#`, and `!` are not allowed in identifiers.

---

### **Your Mission: Practice Writing Identifiers**

Now that you know the rules, try this short exercise:

1. Write a Python program where you declare two variables: one for the name of your ship and one for the number of pirates in your crew.
2. Print a message introducing your ship and crew.
3. Then, try using a Python keyword as a variable name and see what kind of error you get!

```python
# Example Program
ship_name = input("What's the name of your ship? ")
crew_size = int(input("How many pirates are in your crew? "))

print(f"Your ship, {ship_name}, is ready to sail with {crew_size} pirates!")

# Now try this line (it will cause an error):
for = "Navigator"  # ❌ SyntaxError: 'for' is a keyword
```

---

### **Conclusion**

Remember, keywords are reserved for Python’s use, and identifiers are the names you choose to give to different parts of your program. Following these rules will help you write clean and error-free code!

In the next part of our journey, we’ll be navigating the seas of **loops** and **conditionals**—tools that will help us repeat actions and make decisions in our programs. Stay sharp and keep learning, young pirate!

---
### **Exercise Wrap-Up**

Once you’ve completed these exercises, you’ll have a better grasp of Python’s identifiers and keywords! Remember, every pirate must know their ship’s crew by name, and every programmer must know how to name their variables correctly.

Keep practicing, and soon you’ll be navigating the high seas of Python programming with ease!


---
### **Exercise: Mastering Python Identifiers and Keywords**

Ahoy, young pirate! Now that you know the ins and outs of **identifiers** and **keywords**, it’s time to put your skills to the test. Below are some challenges that will help you practice these concepts.

---

### **Exercise 1: Identify the Identifiers**

Read the following Python code snippets and determine which of the variable names are valid identifiers. If they are **invalid**, explain why.

1. ```python
   pirate_name = "Luffy"
   1st_mate = "Zoro"
   ```
   
2. ```python
   ship@name = "Thousand Sunny"
   ship_name = "Thousand Sunny"
   ```
   
3. ```python
   crew_size = 10
   global = "worldwide"
   ```
   
4. ```python
   _treasure_chest = "Gold"
   for = 5
   ```

---

### **Exercise 2: Write Your Own Program**

In this exercise, you will write a small program that follows the rules for identifiers. You’ll create variables to hold the following information and print them out:

- The name of your pirate ship.
- The size of your pirate crew.
- The type of treasure your crew is hunting for.

Follow these steps:

1. Create a variable named `ship_name` and assign it the name of your ship.
2. Create a variable named `crew_size` and assign it the number of pirates in your crew.
3. Create a variable named `treasure_hunt` and assign it the type of treasure you’re looking for.
4. Finally, print out a sentence introducing your ship and your quest for treasure.

Here’s a hint for the structure of your program:

```python
# Declare your variables (follow the identifier rules!)
ship_name = "Thousand Sunny"
crew_size = 9
treasure_hunt = "One Piece"

# Print the result
print(f"Our ship, {ship_name}, with a crew of {crew_size} pirates is on a hunt for the {treasure_hunt}!")
```

---

### **Exercise 3: Catch the Errors**

The following program contains some identifier and keyword mistakes. Run the program and fix the errors:

```python
# Fix the errors below!
1pirate = "Luffy"
crew-size = 10
global = "World Government"

# Print the correct values
print(1pirate)
print(crew-size)
print(global)
```

---

### **Exercise 4: Exploring Keywords**

Using the code from earlier to list all Python keywords, write a program that:
1. Displays the total number of Python keywords.
2. Prints the full list of keywords.
3. Ask the user to input a word and checks whether it’s a Python keyword.

Here’s a hint to get you started:

```python
import keyword

# Step 1: Print the total number of keywords
print("Total number of Python keywords:", len(keyword.kwlist))

# Step 2: Print the full list of keywords
print("List of Python keywords:", keyword.kwlist)

# Step 3: Ask user for input and check if it’s a keyword
user_input = input("Enter a word: ")
if user_input in keyword.kwlist:
    print(f"'{user_input}' is a Python keyword!")
else:
    print(f"'{user_input}' is not a Python keyword.")
```

---

### **Challenge Exercise: Treasure Hunt with Identifiers**

Let’s make things more exciting! You’re creating a game where your pirate crew collects treasure chests. Each chest can contain gold, silver, or gems. Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user how many treasure chests they found.
2. For each chest, ask whether it contains gold, silver, or gems.
3. Keep track of how many chests of each type were found.
4. At the end, print out the total number of gold, silver, and gem chests.

Here's a starting point for you:

```python
# Start by declaring variables to track the count
gold_chests = 0
silver_chests = 0
gem_chests = 0

# Ask the user how many treasure chests they found
chests_found = int(input("How many treasure chests did you find? "))

# Loop through each chest and ask what type it contains
for i in range(chests_found):
    chest_type = input("Is the chest full of 'gold', 'silver', or 'gems'? ").lower()
    if chest_type == "gold":
        gold_chests += 1
    elif chest_type == "silver":
        silver_chests += 1
    elif chest_type == "gems":
        gem_chests += 1
    else:
        print("That's not a valid treasure type!")

# Print the final counts
print(f"You found {gold_chests} gold chests, {silver_chests} silver chests, and {gem_chests} gem chests!")
```

---


### **Comments, Indentation, and Statements: The Pirate’s Code**

Ahoy, pirate! Now that we’ve got a handle on variables, it’s time to learn some of the unspoken rules of programming, just like a pirate crew follows the Pirate’s Code. These rules are the **comments**, **indentation**, and **statements** in your program. They’re what make your code not only work smoothly but also make it readable and understandable by other pirates (or programmers). Let’s dive into these essential elements of programming!

---

### **The Secret Treasure of Comments: Marking the Map**

Every good pirate has a map with notes, clues, and directions. In programming, **comments** are like those scribbled notes on a treasure map—they help others (and your future self) understand what’s going on in your code. Comments won’t be executed by the computer; they’re just for humans to read and make sense of things. If you don’t write comments, it’s like leaving your treasure map blank—your crew might get lost!

#### **Single-line Comments**

In Python, if you want to leave a quick note, just start your line with a `#` (hash) symbol. It’s like leaving a little message for your future self or your fellow coders.

```python
# Print a greeting to the pirate crew
print("Ahoy, Pirate!")
```

Here, the comment `# Print a greeting to the pirate crew` is just for us to understand what’s happening, but it won’t be executed. Only the print statement will run, and the result will be `"Ahoy, Pirate!"`.

#### **Multi-line Comments**

Sometimes, your notes need to be longer, just like when you explain a complex route on the map. You can either use multiple `#` symbols for each line, or you can wrap your comments in triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`) to span multiple lines. This is like writing a detailed message for your entire crew.

```python
# This is a multi-line comment
# explaining how the treasure
# is buried on the island.

"""
This is also a
multi-line comment, perfect for
a detailed explanation.
"""
```

You see, comments help you (and your crew) understand the code long after it’s been written. As you write your programs, always leave notes behind—it’ll save you from confusion later, just like remembering where you buried your treasure!

---

### **Indentation: The Pirate’s Way of Organizing**

In the pirate world, discipline is key—everyone has their place on the ship, and everyone follows a chain of command. In programming, **indentation** is like the discipline of your code. It helps keep everything organized and makes sure the computer knows what belongs where.

Most programming languages use curly braces `{}` to mark where code blocks start and end, but in Python, we use **indentation**. This means when a piece of code belongs to a specific block (like a function or a loop), it has to be indented correctly.

For example, let’s take this simple loop to print the numbers 1 through 5:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)  # This line is indented, so it's part of the loop
```

#### **How Indentation Works:**
- The line under the `for` loop is indented, meaning it belongs to the loop. If you remove the indentation, Python won’t know what’s inside the loop.
- Usually, 4 spaces (or a tab) are used for indentation. But be consistent—mixing spaces and tabs can confuse your code!

Here’s what happens if you forget to indent:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
print(i)  # Oops! Forgot to indent this line.
```

You’ll get an error! That’s like trying to sail the ship without following the captain’s orders—it’s bound to go wrong.

---

### **The Power of Python Statements: Pirate Orders**

Pirate captains give clear and concise orders, right? In Python, we do the same thing with **statements**. A statement is an instruction that the computer can execute. You’ve already seen examples of this:

```python
a = 1  # This is a single statement.
print(a)  # Another single statement that prints the value of 'a'.
```

#### **Multiple Statements on One Line**

Sometimes, a pirate needs to give a lot of orders quickly. In Python, you can give multiple commands on a single line by separating them with a semicolon `;`.

```python
a = 10; b = 20; c = 30  # Multiple statements on one line
print(a, b, c)
```

This prints out: `10 20 30`.

#### **Multi-line Statements**

But what if your order is long and complex, like a strategy for attacking a Marine base? In Python, you can extend a statement over multiple lines using the backslash `\` symbol or by wrapping everything in parentheses `()`.

```python
# Using a backslash to extend a statement
a = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8
print(a)

# Using parentheses to extend a statement
b = (1 + 2 + 3 +
     4 + 5 + 6 +
     7 + 8)
print(b)
```

Both methods give you the same result: `36`. Now you can write long strategies that span several lines without confusing the computer—or your crew!

### **Exercise for Aspiring Pirates: Chart Your Own Course**

Before we hoist the sails and dive into loops and conditionals, let’s see how well you’ve learned the Pirate’s Code. Here’s a small challenge for you:

1. Write a Python program that does the following:
   - Use comments to explain what your program does.
   - Create a variable and store a number in it.
   - Use indentation to print the number if it’s greater than 5.
   - Combine multiple statements on a single line.

Here’s a little start for you:

```python
# This program checks if a number is greater than 5
num = 10  # Assign a value to the variable

# Check if the number is greater than 5
if num > 5:
    print(f"{num} is greater than 5!")  # Indented line inside the if statement

# Multiple statements in one line
a = 1; b = 2; print(a + b)
```

Once you’ve written your code, run it and see the result. Did everything work as expected? If not, check for missing indentation or semicolons. Don’t worry, even the best pirates make mistakes—it’s all part of the adventure!

# Reviews On Variables and Data Types

Ah, my friend, we've already set sail on the topic of variables, as our matey Luffy mentioned earlier. But it seems a few points might have slipped through the cracks of your treasure map. Allow me to chart our course back and give you a quick refresher!
#### **What Are Variables?**

A **variable** is a location in memory used to store some data (or value). Just like every pirate needs a unique treasure map to locate their bounty, every variable has a unique name to differentiate it from other variables. 

In Python, you don’t need to declare a variable before using it. Simply assign a value, and voilà! The variable exists. Python handles the data type for you, depending on the value you assign. Let’s look at some examples:

```python
# Assigning values to variables
a = 10           # Integer
b = 5.5          # Float
c = "One Piece"         # String
```

#### **Variable Assignments**

We use the **assignment operator** (`=`) to assign values to variables. Just like giving your crew orders, you tell the variable what it should hold:

```python
# Multiple assignments in one line
a, b, c = 10, 5.5, "Nami"  # Assigning different values to multiple variables
# Or
a = b = c = "Luffy"         # Assign the same value to multiple variables
```

#### **Storage Locations**

Every variable has a memory address where its value is stored. Let’s explore this with some examples:

```python
x = 3
print(id(x))  # Print the memory address of variable x

y = 3
print(id(y))  # Print the memory address of variable y

# Observation: Both x and y point to the same memory location
y = 2
print(id(y))  # Print the new memory address of variable y
```

When you run the code, you'll notice that changing the value of `y` updates its memory address, while `x` remains unchanged. 

#### **Data Types: The Classes of Our Variables**

Every treasure has its type, and so do our variables! In Python, every value has a data type, and since everything is an object, variables are instances (or objects) of these classes.

1. **Numbers**: This includes integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers, defined as `int`, `float`, and `complex` in Python. Let’s see how we can check the data type of a variable:

```python
a = 5
print(a, "is of type", type(a))  # Data type is implicitly set to integer

a = 2.5
print(a, "is of type", type(a))  # Data type is now float

a = 1 + 2j
print(a, "is complex number?")  # Data type is complex
print(isinstance(1 + 2j, complex))  # Check if it's a complex number
```

2. **Boolean**: This represents the truth values `False` and `True`.

```python
a = True  # a is a boolean type
print(type(a))
```

3. **Strings**: Strings are sequences of Unicode characters. You can use single or double quotes, and even triple quotes for multi-line strings!

```python
s = "This is an Online AI course"
print(s)               # Print the string
print(s[0])           # Access the first character
print(s[-1])          # Access the last character
print(s[5:])          # Slicing the string
```

4. **Lists**: Lists are ordered sequences of items that can be of different types, like a pirate’s treasure trove!

```python
a = [10, 20.5, "Hello"]
print(a[1])          # Print the 1st index element
a[1] = 30.7         # Lists are mutable
print(a)            # Output the modified list
```

5. **Tuples**: Similar to lists but immutable. Once you create a tuple, you can't change it.

```python
t = (1, 1.5, "ML")
print(t[1])         # Extract a specific element
# t[1] = 1.25       # This will raise an error
```

6. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items. Like a stash of unique treasures!

```python
a = {10, 30, 20, 40, 5}
print(a)            # Output the set
print(type(a))     # Check the type
```

7. **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.

```python
d = {'a': "apple", 'b': "bat"}
print(d['a'])      # Accessing a value using its key
```

#### **Comments and Documentation**

Just like a pirate keeps a detailed log of their adventures, we use **comments** to make our code easier to understand. Comments are ignored by the interpreter, making the code more readable for us landlubbers:

```python
# This is a single-line comment in Python

# Multi-line comments can be created like this:
# This is a long comment
# and it extends 
# Multiple lines
```

For longer explanations, we can use **triple quotes**:

```python
"""
This is also a
perfect example of
multi-line comments
"""
```

In Python, we also have **Docstrings**, which are special comments used to describe functions, classes, or modules:

```python
def Square(num):
    """
    Function to double the number
    """
    return num * num

print(Square(10))  # Calls the function
```

#### **Common Errors When Working with Variables**

While sailing the seas of Python, you might run into some common errors when dealing with variables:

1. **Using Keywords as Identifiers**: Keywords are special words in Python that have predefined meanings, and they cannot be used as variable names. For example:

```python
global = 1  # This will raise a SyntaxError
```

2. **Invalid Characters**: You cannot use special symbols like `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, or `%` in variable names. For instance:

```python
a@ = 10  # This will also raise a SyntaxError
```

3. **Starting with a Digit**: A variable name cannot begin with a number. This is invalid:

```python
1variable = 5  # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

#### **Conversion Between Data Types**

Sometimes, you may need to convert one type of treasure to another. Use functions like `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` to convert between types:

```python
# Convert between different data types
float_value = float(5)       # Convert integer to float
int_value = int(100.5)       # Convert float to integer
string_value = str(20)       # Convert integer to string

# Be careful! This won't work if the string isn't a number
# int('10p')  # Uncommenting this line will raise an error
```

Now you’re well-equipped with the knowledge of variables and data types in Python, just like Luffy is ready with his trusty crew! Are you ready to sail into the realm of loops and conditionals? Let’s continue our grand adventure!

#  **Input and Output** 

Alright, let’s embark on a new chapter of our adventure, diving into the world of **Input and Output** in Python! Just like a pirate needs a map to navigate the seas, we need input and output to interact with our programs. This will help us capture information and present it back to the user. Let's set sail!

### Python Output

In Python, we use the `print()` function to output data to the standard output device (usually the console). It's a straightforward way to communicate with our fellow pirates (or users)!

Here are some examples of how to use the `print()` function:

```python
# Basic output
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a simple greeting to the console.

# Outputting variable values
a = 10
print("The value of a is", a)  # This shows how to print a variable alongside a message.
```

#### Output Formatting
We can also format our output to make it more readable. Here are some techniques:

1. **Using `format()` Method**:
   ```python
   a = 10
   b = 20
   # Multiple statements in a single line.
   print("The value of a is {} and b is {}".format(a, b))  # Default order.

   # Specify position of arguments
   print("The value of b is {1} and a is {0}".format(a, b)) 

   # Using keyword arguments
   print("Hello {name}, {greeting}".format(name="Luffy", greeting="Good Morning"))  

   # Combine positional and keyword arguments
   print('The story of {0}, {1}, and {other}'.format('Ussup', 'Sanji', other='Zoro'))
   ```

### Python Input

Now, let’s talk about how we can gather information from our user, just like asking our crew what treasure they seek. In Python, we use the `input()` function for this purpose:

```python
# Taking input from the user
num = input("Enter a number: ")
print(num)  # This will print whatever the user enters.
```

#### Important Points About Input:
- The value returned by `input()` is always a string. If we want to treat it as a number, we need to convert it using functions like `int()` or `float()`.
  
  For example:
  ```python
  # Convert input to an integer
  num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # User must enter a valid integer.
  print("The number you entered is", num)
  ```

### A Pirate's Note on Input and Output

As a pirate navigating the seas of programming, understanding how to gather input and present output is crucial. It allows us to communicate effectively with our programs, making them interactive and engaging!

Now that you’ve got the hang of input and output in Python, you’re well on your way to becoming a master coder! Keep practicing, and remember, just like any great adventure, every little step counts!

### 🏴‍☠️ Operators in Python

**Operators** are like special tools in a pirate's toolkit, essential for navigating the seas of coding. Each operator serves a unique purpose, helping us perform various tasks. Let's explore these operators through our adventure!

### 🚢 Types of Operators

1. **Arithmetic Operators**  
2. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**  
3. **Logical (Boolean) Operators**  
4. **Bitwise Operators**  
5. **Assignment Operators**  
6. **Special Operators**  

---

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**

In the bustling port town of **Arithmetic**, our brave captain, Captain Add, was always busy counting treasures. With his trusty map marked with symbols, he could quickly tally up his riches using the arithmetic operators:

- **Addition (`+`)**: Captain Add would add his gold coins together to see how much treasure he had amassed.  
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: After sharing some gold with his crew, he’d subtract the amount given away.  
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: When the crew won a bounty, he multiplied their shares based on the crew size.  
- **Division (`/`)**: Dividing the spoils among his crew was always a task for Captain Divide.  
- **Modulo (`%`)**: When they found out how many coins would be left over after sharing equally, Captain Modulo would step in.  
- **Floor Division (`//`)**: Captain Floor had a keen eye for the number of complete shares each crew member would receive.  
- **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Whenever they found treasure maps leading to treasure multiplied by itself, Captain Exponent would lead the way!

**Example:**

```python
x, y = 10, 20

# Addition
print(x + y)  # Output: 30
```

---

### 2. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**

In the land of **Comparison**, the wise judge, Judge Relational, was always keen on making decisions based on facts. He would ask questions to find out which pirate was the mightiest or the swiftest by comparing their strengths. His tools were the comparison operators:

- **Greater than (`>`)**: "Is Pirate Bill stronger than Pirate Jack?"  
- **Less than (`<`)**: "Is Pirate Sam quicker than Pirate Dave?"  
- **Equal to (`==`)**: "Are they equally skilled?"  
- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: "Is there any difference in their treasure?"  
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: "Is she as talented as her sister, or better?"  
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: "Is he at least as fast as the last crew member?"

**Example:**

```python
a, b = 10, 20

print(a < b)   # Output: True
```

---

### 3. **Logical (Boolean) Operators**

In the strategic war room of **Logical**, Captain Logic gathered his crew for discussions about their plans. The three wise advisors—Sir AND, Lady OR, and Lord NOT—helped make critical decisions:

- **AND**: "If both the tides are favorable **and** the winds are right, we shall set sail!"  
- **OR**: "If we can find treasure **or** a new ship, our journey shall be worthwhile!"  
- **NOT**: "If we **do not** encounter enemy ships, we can sail without worry!"

**Example:**

```python
a, b = True, False

# Logical AND
print(a and b)  # Output: False
```

---

### 4. **Bitwise Operators**

Deep within the **Bitwise** realm, the Binary Knights worked tirelessly. Each knight specialized in manipulating the bits of treasure maps. They could dig deep into the binary treasure of numbers:

- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Two knights would work together, uniting only their common bits.  
- **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Whenever they merged their maps, they’d combine all possible routes.  
- **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: The reverse knight flipped all bits, revealing hidden paths.  
- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: The clever knight who identified differences among maps was always on alert.  
- **Bitwise right shift (`>>`)**: Shifting the map right showed the crew what lay ahead.  
- **Bitwise left shift (`<<`)**: Shifting left expanded their horizons and revealed treasures further away.

**Example:**

```python
a, b = 10, 4

# Bitwise AND
print(a & b)  # Output: 0
```

---

### 5. **Assignment Operators**

In the castle of **Assignment**, the royal scribe, Sir Assign, diligently wrote down the treasures and treasures yet to be found. He would use his various quills—each representing an assignment operator—to keep track of the kingdom's wealth:

- **Simple assignment (`=`)**: "Here is the value of our treasure chest!"  
- **Add and assign (`+=`)**: "Let’s add more gold to our treasure chest!"  
- **Subtract and assign (`-=`)**: "We’ve given away some treasure; let’s adjust the chest!"  
- **Multiply and assign (`*=`)**: "If we win more gold, multiply our riches!"  
- **Divide and assign (`/=`)**: "Dividing our spoils requires an adjustment!"  
- **Modulo and assign (`%=`)**: "Let’s find out what remains after sharing!"  
- **Floor divide and assign (`//=`)**: "We’ll only take complete shares!"  
- **Exponent and assign (`**=`)**: "Let’s double our treasure!"

**Example:**

```python
a = 10

a += 5    # a = a + 5
print(a)  # Output: 15
```

---

### 6. **Special Operators**

In the land of **Special Operators**, there were unique guards who ensured that treasures were handled correctly. The wise elders, Sir Identity and Lady Membership, kept an eye on the variables:

#### **Identity Operators**

Sir Identity checked if two treasures were the same by asking, "Are these two chests one and the same?" 

- **is**: "Do they share the same golden contents?"  
- **is not**: "Are they different in their essence?"

**Example:**

```python
a = 5
b = 5

print(a is b)  # Output: True
```

#### **Membership Operators**

Lady Membership stood at the gates, asking if the treasure was included in the lists of riches:

- **in**: "Is this gold coin part of our collection?"  
- **not in**: "Is this coin missing from our treasure chest?"

**Example:**

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Check if 1 is present in the list
print(1 in lst)  # Output: True
```

---

### Conclusion

And there you have it! Just as our pirates and adventurers utilize their unique tools, you now have a treasure trove of knowledge about operators in Python. With these operators, you can navigate the seas of coding, performing calculations, comparisons, and logical operations. So hoist the sails, wield your operators, and let the coding adventures begin! 🏴‍☠️

# Decisions

Ahoy there, future code pirates! 🏴‍☠️
Let's talk about **decisions** in Python using the **if...else** statement. Just like how a captain decides which direction to steer the ship, programs use conditions to make decisions. Python gives us a neat way to handle this using **if, elif, and else**. Let's break it down with some examples and see how our ship sails through different waters.

---

### **The Simple "If" Statement**

Here’s the basic rule: if a condition is true, we execute a block of code. If it’s false, we skip it!

**Syntax:**
```python
if test_expression:
    # Statement(s) to execute if True
```

Let’s look at an example:

```python
num = 10

# We try 0, -1, or None here too!
if num > 0:
    print("Number is positive")
print("This will always print")
```

Here, the program checks if the number is positive. If it is, we print a message. Otherwise, we move on, but **"This will always print"** because it's outside the `if` block. In Python, **0** and **None** are treated as **False**, while any non-zero value is **True**!

---

### **If...Else Statement**

Sometimes, when the condition is false, we want to take another action. That’s where `else` comes in—like choosing a backup plan if Plan A fails!

**Syntax:**
```python
if test_expression:
    # Statement(s) for True
else:
    # Statement(s) for False
```

**Example:**
```python
num = 10
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

The ship sails one way if `num > 0` and another way if it doesn’t. Simple, right?

---

### **If...Elif...Else Statement**

But what if we have **multiple conditions** to check? Let’s say we want to check if a number is positive, zero, or negative. We can use `elif` (short for "else if") to check extra conditions.

**Syntax:**
```python
if test_expression:
    # Statement(s) for True
elif test_expression:
    # Statement(s) for this condition
else:
    # Statement(s) for all other cases
```

**Example:**
```python
num = 0
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("ZERO")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

We’re checking all possibilities here, just like a lookout scanning the horizon in every direction!

---

### **Nested If Statements**

Sometimes, we need to check a condition **inside** another condition—like asking, "If we’re close to the island, is it safe to land?" This is called **nesting**.

**Example:**
```python
num = 10.5

if num >= 0:
    if num == 0:
        print("Zero")
    else:
        print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

Here, we first check if the number is non-negative. Then, **inside** that block, we check if it’s zero or positive. Think of it as multiple layers of decision-making.

---

### **Finding the Largest of Three Numbers**

Now, let’s put everything together in a more interesting problem: finding the largest of three numbers using logical operators like **and**.

**Example:**
```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 50
num3 = 15

if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
    largest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
    largest = num2
else:
    largest = num3
print("The largest number is:", largest)
```

We’re comparing all three numbers and deciding which one is the largest. It's like choosing the best island to dock your ship!

---

So, that’s how Python helps us make decisions, just like a captain deciding the ship’s course. Now you can write programs that can choose different actions based on conditions. Sail on, and let the logic guide your code! 🏴‍☠️

As our crew continues its thrilling voyage, we encounter situations that demand repetitive tasks or decisions—just like navigating stormy seas or deciding whether to battle Marines or flee to safety. In programming, we use **loops** and **conditionals** for these exact purposes.

### **Loops**
Loops in Python are like navigating a maze—repeating a task until you reach your destination. When counting treasure, fighting enemies, or tracking the wind, loops keep the process going until the task is complete.

Let’s look at the **while loop**, which repeats a task as long as the condition is true—just like Luffy searching for the One Piece, never stopping until he finds it.

```python
# Imagine Luffy is counting the gold coins in his treasure chest
lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60]
product = 1
index = 0

# While loop to multiply all numbers in the list
while index < len(lst):
    product *= lst[index]
    index += 1

print(f"The product of the treasure is: {product}")
```

In this example, Luffy keeps multiplying the numbers in the list until he reaches the end. The loop runs as long as `index < len(lst)` remains true.

#### **while Loop with else**
Even after a battle or a search ends, there can be a final action—like gathering your crew after the fight. Python’s `while` loop can have an **else** block, which executes when the loop finishes without any interruptions.

```python
# Imagine checking all the items in the treasure chest
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
index = 0

while index < len(numbers):
    print(f"Checking item number {numbers[index]}")
    index += 1
else:
    print("All items have been checked!")
```

In this case, Luffy checks each treasure item, and once the loop is done, he proudly announces that all items are accounted for. If the loop had been broken early (like if a treasure was missing), the `else` block would not run.

### **Prime Number Check**
Sometimes, you need to know if a challenge is truly formidable. Just like a prime number—a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself—let’s create a program to check whether a number is prime.

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Luffy checks if a number is prime
isDivisible = False
i = 2

while i < num:
    if num % i == 0:
        isDivisible = True
        print(f"{num} is divisible by {i}")
    i += 1

if isDivisible:
    print(f"{num} is NOT a Prime number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is a Prime number")
```

Here, Luffy checks each divisor to see if the number can be divided. If it can be divided, the number is not prime. Otherwise, it’s a prime number—a true challenge for any pirate!

---

Now, let’s talk about the **for loop**, which allows us to iterate over sequences like lists, just as Luffy and his crew travel from one island to another.

```python
lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
product = 1

# Luffy multiplies the value of each item in his treasure chest
for ele in lst:
    product *= ele

print(f"The product of all treasure is: {product}")
```

In this code, Luffy multiplies the value of each item in his treasure chest one by one, just as he carefully examines his bounty after a long day at sea.

#### **range() function**
When you want to count something in a specific order—like tallying bounties or measuring distances between islands—Python’s `range()` function comes in handy.

```python
# Let's say Luffy wants to count the number of pirates from 1 to 10
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

Or, Luffy might want to count the steps between each island with a gap of 5 steps:

```python
# Counting steps between islands
for i in range(0, 20, 5):
    print(i)
```

In this code, Luffy counts every fifth step until he reaches the final destination.

---

#### **for Loop with else**
Just like the `while` loop, a `for` loop can have an optional `else` block. It’s like Luffy checking every member of his crew after a battle—once the check is complete, the `else` block lets him know everyone is accounted for.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

for item in numbers:
    print(item)
else:
    print("No item left in the list!")
```

However, if something interrupts the process—such as finding an even number early—the `else` block will be ignored:

```python
for item in numbers:
    print(item)
    if item % 2 == 0:
        break
else:
    print("No item left in the list!")
```

If Luffy finds an even number early in the list, he breaks out of the loop and doesn’t execute the `else` block.

---

Finally, let’s display all the **prime numbers** between an interval—just as Luffy might count all the Marine ships he spots on the horizon.

```python
index1 = 20
index2 = 50

print(f"Prime numbers between {index1} and {index2} are:")

for num in range(index1, index2 + 1):
    if num > 1:
        isDivisible = False
        for index in range(2, num):
            if num % index == 0:
                isDivisible = True
        if not isDivisible:
            print(num)
```

Here, Luffy examines each number between 20 and 50, checking if it’s prime—just like watching for enemy ships between islands.

---

### Adventure Continues:
As our journey with Python and Luffy continues, you’ll see how these loops and conditionals help us handle even the wildest challenges. Whether repeating tasks with loops or making decisions with conditionals, you’ll have the tools to conquer any coding challenge—just as Luffy does with each new island!

Ready to continue the adventure? Let’s sail onward and explore the seas of computer science!

---
Aye, aye, captain! Let’s turn our learning into some thrilling coding adventures, with each challenge like a step closer to finding the One Piece! Below are exercises based on everything we've explored so far, each crafted in the spirit of Luffy’s grand pirate journey.

---

### **1. The Pirate Crew Gold Count (Loops)**
**Challenge:** Luffy's crew has collected a treasure chest with an unknown number of gold coins. You need to count how many coins are in the chest using a loop.

**Instructions:**
- Write a Python program that asks Luffy how many gold coins he has.
- Use a **for loop** to print each coin number as you count them.
  
```python
# Sample code structure:
gold_coins = int(input("How many gold coins does Luffy have? "))

# Use a loop to count each coin
for coin in range(1, gold_coins + 1):
    print(f"Counting coin number {coin}!")
```

---

### **2. Navigating the Stormy Seas (Conditionals)**
**Challenge:** Luffy’s ship encounters a storm, and he has to decide whether to sail left, right, or wait for the storm to pass. Help Luffy make the right decision!

**Instructions:**
- Use a **conditional statement** to check the weather. If the left path is safe, sail left. If the right path is safer, sail right. Otherwise, Luffy should wait.
  
```python
# Sample code structure:
left_path_safe = False
right_path_safe = True

if left_path_safe:
    print("Luffy sails left through the storm!")
elif right_path_safe:
    print("Luffy takes the safer right path!")
else:
    print("Luffy waits until the storm passes.")
```

### **3. Counting Bounty Posters (While Loop)**
**Challenge:** The Marines have put up bounty posters for the Straw Hat Pirates all over the city. Luffy wants to find out how many posters are around. Keep counting until Luffy has checked all the posters!

**Instructions:**
- Create a list of bounty poster values and use a **while loop** to count how many posters there are.
  
```python
# Sample code structure:
bounty_posters = [50, 75, 120, 300, 400]
poster_count = 0

while poster_count < len(bounty_posters):
    print(f"Poster number {poster_count + 1}: {bounty_posters[poster_count]} million berries!")
    poster_count += 1
```

---

### **4. Who Has the Highest Bounty? (If-Elif-Else)**
**Challenge:** Compare the bounties of Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji to find out who has the highest bounty in the crew.

**Instructions:**
- Write a program that takes Luffy's, Zoro's, and Sanji's bounties and determines who has the highest.
  
```python
# Sample code structure:
luffy_bounty = 1500000000
zoro_bounty = 320000000
sanji_bounty = 330000000

if luffy_bounty > zoro_bounty and luffy_bounty > sanji_bounty:
    print("Luffy has the highest bounty!")
elif zoro_bounty > luffy_bounty and zoro_bounty > sanji_bounty:
    print("Zoro has the highest bounty!")

```python
# Sample code structure:
lock_number = int(input("Enter the secret lock number: "))

is_prime = True
i = 2

while i < lock_number:
    if lock_number % i == 0:
        is_prime = False
        break
    i += 1

if is_prime:

**Challenge:** While sailing, Luffy spots some Marine ships ahead. He needs to avoid the ones that are too strong but can safely engage the weaker ships.

**Instructions:**
- Use a **for loop** and **break** when encountering a strong Marine ship and **continue** when skipping weaker ones.
  
```python
# Sample code structure:
marine_ships = [100, 200, 800, 150, 900]  # Ship strength in order
threshold = 700  # Ships stronger than this must be avoided

for ship in marine_ships:
    if ship > threshold:
        print(f"Too strong! Avoid Marine ship with strength {ship}.")
        break
    else:
        print(f"Engaging Marine ship with strength {ship}.")
```

---

### **8. The Grand Prime Adventure (Finding Prime Numbers)**

**Instructions:**
- Write a program that finds all the prime numbers between two given numbers using **nested loops**.
  
```python
# Sample code structure:
start = 10
end = 50

print(f"Prime numbers between {start} and {end}:")

for num in range(start, end + 1):
    if num > 1:
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            print(num)
```

---

### **1. Zoro's Sword Counting (For Loop)**
Zoro is polishing his swords for the next battle, and he needs to keep track of them. Can you help him count each sword he polishes?

**Exercise:**  
- Use a **for loop** to iterate over a list of Zoro’s swords (`swords = ["Wado Ichimonji", "Enma", "Sandai Kitetsu"]`) and print each sword’s name.
  
```python
swords = ["Wado Ichimonji", "Enma", "Sandai Kitetsu"]

# Your code here: Use a for loop to print each sword
```

---

### **2. Nami’s Weather Decision (If-Else)**
Nami, the navigator, must decide which direction the crew should sail depending on the weather. If it’s sunny, they’ll go north; if it’s stormy, they’ll go south; otherwise, they’ll stay at sea and wait.

**Exercise:**  
- Use an **if-else** structure to print Nami’s decision based on the weather condition (`weather = "stormy"`).
  
```python
weather = "stormy"

# Your code here: Make a decision based on the weather
```

---

### **3. Luffy’s Treasure Hunt (While Loop)**
Luffy found a clue to a treasure but needs to count all the clues before he can find it. Can you help him collect all the clues?

**Exercise:**  
- Use a **while loop** to count each clue until Luffy has found all 10 clues.
  
```python
clues_found = 0
total_clues = 10

# Your code here: Use a while loop to count the clues
```

---

### **4. Sanji’s Ingredient Search (Break Statement)**
Sanji is looking for the perfect ingredient for a dish. He has a list of ingredients, but he’ll stop searching as soon as he finds “truffle.”

**Exercise:**  
- Use a **for loop** and the **break** statement to stop searching once “truffle” is found in the list (`ingredients = ["garlic", "pepper", "truffle", "onion"]`).

```python
ingredients = ["garlic", "pepper", "truffle", "onion"]

# Your code here: Use a for loop and break to stop when truffle is found
```

---

### **5. Usopp’s Shooting Practice (Range and For Loop)**
Usopp is practicing his shooting skills by hitting targets. He has 5 targets lined up, and he needs to shoot each one in order.

**Exercise:**  
- Use the **range()** function and a **for loop** to print each shot from 1 to 5 as Usopp takes his shots.

```python
# Your code here: Use range and a for loop to simulate Usopp's shots
```

---

### **6. Chopper’s Medical Check (If-Elif-Else)**
Chopper is checking on the health of each crew member. If their temperature is above 38°C, he declares them sick. If it’s between 36°C and 38°C, they are healthy. If it’s below 36°C, he thinks they’re freezing.

**Exercise:**  
- Write a program that checks a crew member's temperature (`temperature = 37.5`) and prints their health condition.

```python
temperature = 37.5

# Your code here: Use if-elif-else to check the health condition
```

---

### **7. Franky’s Ship Repair (While-Else Loop)**
Franky is fixing the Sunny, and he has a list of parts that need repair. He’ll work on each part until all are fixed. Once the list is empty, he’ll declare the ship ready to sail.

**Exercise:**  
- Use a **while loop** to print each part being repaired. When the list is empty, print "The ship is ready to sail."

```python
parts = ["mast", "sail", "anchor", "hull"]

# Your code here: Use a while loop to repair each part, then print the ship is ready
```

---

### **8. Robin’s Archaeology Quiz (Prime Number Check)**
Robin is trying to decipher a secret number that might lead to a Poneglyph. She wants to know if the number is prime, as prime numbers have historical significance.

**Exercise:**  
- Write a program that checks whether a given number (`num = 29`) is a prime number.

```python
num = 29

# Your code here: Check if num is a prime number
```

---

### **9. Brook’s Song Repetition (For Loop with Else)**
Brook is performing a song for the crew. He’ll sing each line of the song, and once he’s done, he’ll say, “Yohoho, no more lines left to sing!”

**Exercise:**  
- Use a **for loop** with an **else** to print each line from the list (`song = ["Bink's Sake", "Sail the seas", "Drink up me hearties!"`) and then print a message after the loop finishes.

```python
song = ["Bink's Sake", "Sail the seas", "Drink up me hearties!"]

# Your code here: Use a for loop with else to sing Brook's song
```

---

### **10. Searching for the Pirate King’s Prime Coordinates (For Loop with Nested Loop)**
There are rumors that the coordinates to the One Piece are hidden in prime numbers between two values. Can you find all the prime numbers between two given points?

**Exercise:**  
- Write a program using a **nested loop** to find all the prime numbers between `start = 10` and `end = 30`.

```python
start = 10
end = 30

# Your code here: Use a nested loop to find the prime numbers
```

---

### Bonus Exercise: **Luffy’s Gear Four Puzzle (Nested If)**
Luffy is using Gear Four, but he can switch between different forms depending on the situation. Help him decide which form to use!

**Exercise:**  
- If the enemy is fast, Luffy uses `Snakeman`. If the enemy is strong, he uses `Boundman`. If both conditions are met, he uses `Tankman`. Write a program using **nested if** to help Luffy choose the right form.

```python
enemy_fast = True
enemy_strong = False

# Your code here: Use nested if to choose the right Gear Four form
```

# Project 1:  Straw Hat Calculator

Aye, aye, captain! Let’s build a small demo project: **The Straw Hat Calculator** — a tool the Straw Hat Pirates would use to calculate the treasure they’ve found, their next destination’s distance, or even split the treasure equally among the crew! We’ll use everything we’ve learned so far: loops, conditionals, operators, and more.

### **Straw Hat Calculator** Overview:
Our calculator will be able to:
1. Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. Check if a number is prime (useful for Robin’s research!).
3. Split the treasure equally among the crew (using loops).
4. Include a fun bonus where the user can help Luffy decide whether to fight or flee based on the enemy's strength and speed.

---

### Step 1: Define the Calculator Menu
First, we’ll create a menu that lets the user choose which operation to perform.

```python
def show_menu():
    print("\nAhoy, Straw Hat! What would you like to do?")
    print("1. Perform a basic arithmetic operation")
    print("2. Check if a number is prime")
    print("3. Split treasure equally among the crew")
    print("4. Help Luffy decide whether to fight or flee")
    print("5. Exit the calculator")
```

---

### Step 2: Implement Basic Arithmetic Operations
This part will handle the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

```python
def basic_operations():
    print("\nTime to calculate some treasure!")
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    print("\nChoose the operation:")
    print("1. Addition (+)")
    print("2. Subtraction (-)")
    print("3. Multiplication (*)")
    print("4. Division (/)")

    operation = input("Enter the operation: ")

    if operation == '1':
        result = num1 + num2
        print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {result}.")
    elif operation == '2':
        result = num1 - num2
        print(f"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {result}.")
    elif operation == '3':
        result = num1 * num2
        print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {result}.")
    elif operation == '4':
        if num2 != 0:
            result = num1 / num2
            print(f"{num1} divided by {num2} equals {result}.")
        else:
            print("Oops! Division by zero is not allowed!")
    else:
        print("Invalid operation selected!")
```

---

### Step 3: Prime Number Check
Robin needs a prime number check for her Poneglyph research! We’ll help her by writing a function that checks whether a number is prime.

```python
def is_prime():
    print("\nLet’s see if your number is prime!")
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    if num < 2:
        print(f"{num} is NOT a prime number.")
        return

    is_prime = True
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            print(f"{num} is divisible by {i}.")
            break

    if is_prime:
        print(f"{num} is a prime number!")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is NOT a prime number.")
```

---

### Step 4: Split Treasure Among the Crew
Sanji needs to split the treasure equally among the crew. We’ll use loops and arithmetic to divide the treasure.

```python
def split_treasure():
    print("\nTime to split the treasure!")
    treasure = float(input("Enter the total treasure amount (in berries): "))
    crew_members = int(input("Enter the number of crew members: "))

    if crew_members > 0:
        share = treasure / crew_members
        print(f"Each crew member gets {share:.2f} berries!")
    else:
        print("You need at least one crew member to split the treasure!")
```

---

### Step 5: Help Luffy Decide to Fight or Flee
Luffy must decide whether to fight an enemy based on their strength and speed. Let’s help him make that decision using conditionals!

```python
def fight_or_flee():
    print("\nLuffy needs your help to decide!")
    enemy_fast = input("Is the enemy fast? (yes/no): ").lower() == 'yes'
    enemy_strong = input("Is the enemy strong? (yes/no): ").lower() == 'yes'

    if enemy_fast and enemy_strong:
        print("Luffy uses Tankman!")
    elif enemy_fast:
        print("Luffy uses Snakeman!")
    elif enemy_strong:
        print("Luffy uses Boundman!")
    else:
        print("Luffy decides to fight in base form!")
```

---

### Step 6: Putting It All Together
Now, we’ll put everything together into a loop that allows the user to choose from the menu and use the calculator multiple times.

```python
def straw_hat_calculator():
    while True:
        show_menu()
        choice = input("\nEnter your choice (1-5): ")

        if choice == '1':
            basic_operations()
        elif choice == '2':
            is_prime()
        elif choice == '3':
            split_treasure()
        elif choice == '4':
            fight_or_flee()
        elif choice == '5':
            print("Goodbye, Straw Hat! Until next time!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice! Please select a valid option.")
```

---

### Step 7: Let’s Run Our Project!

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    straw_hat_calculator()
```

---

### **Sample Output**
```
Ahoy, Straw Hat! What would you like to do?
1. Perform a basic arithmetic operation
2. Check if a number is prime
3. Split treasure equally among the crew
4. Help Luffy decide whether to fight or flee
5. Exit the calculator

Enter your choice (1-5): 1

Time to calculate some treasure!
Enter the first number: 100
Enter the second number: 50

Choose the operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter the operation: 1
The sum of 100.0 and 50.0 is 150.0.
```

---

### **Explanation:**
- We’ve used **if-else** statements to help Luffy decide whether to fight or flee.
- We’ve used **for loops** to check for prime numbers for Robin’s research.
- We’ve implemented **basic arithmetic operations** with operators like addition and division for counting treasure.
- We split the treasure using **loops and conditionals**, making sure the crew gets their fair share.

---

And that’s it! The **Straw Hat Calculator** is now complete! You can use this to calculate everything from the treasure’s value to Luffy’s battle strategies. Happy coding, captain!
